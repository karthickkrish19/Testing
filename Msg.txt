Storage Account: saoutreachtfstateprod
Observation:
The platform flagged public access as enabled for the above storage account. Public access settings are typically restricted to prevent unintentional data exposure; therefore, this was reviewed to confirm business justification and risk controls.

Following an internal review and discussion with the responsible application team, the following points were confirmed:
Public access is intentional and required to support Terraform remote state operations and outreach-related workflows.
Access is limited to specific containers and monitored through Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
No sensitive or confidential data is exposed publicly.
The configuration is by design, reviewed, and approved by the business team.
Conclusion:
This configuration does not represent a misconfiguration or security vulnerability. Public access is purposeful and controlled, implemented to meet operational and business requirements.
Recommended Action:
No remediation is required at this time. Please proceed to remove or close the associated alert/ticket from the Security Platform, as the configuration is intentional and approved
